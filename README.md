Practice integrating RoomDB with Jetpack Compose by creating a simple app:

Set Up RoomDB: Define an Entity, DAO, and Database.


ViewModel: Use LiveData or Flow to observe database changes and manage data insertion.


Compose UI: Use LazyColumn to display data and TextField + Button to add new entries.

Connect: Combine everything to update the UI dynamically with RoomDB.
